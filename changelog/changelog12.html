            Trainers now follow you around and spot you! You can now show off your trainers at all times! Once you hop onto a michine they'll spot you and make sure you're doing it right.<br><br>

            <b>New Slime Pack</b><br>
            We've added a 4.2x Muscle + Luck based gear to the new pack which also has new Mega Potions that come with it for the price of 999 Robux.<br><br>

            <b>Progression Tacking System</b><br>
